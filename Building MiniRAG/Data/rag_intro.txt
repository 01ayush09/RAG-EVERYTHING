Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines a retrieval system with a generative model.
RAG systems first retrieve relevant context from a document store and then condition a
language model on that context to produce accurate, grounded responses.
This approach is useful for question answering, summarization, and building chatbots that
require up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge.
